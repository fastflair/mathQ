First, we know that f(1)=5. This means that when we plug in 1 for x in our equation, we get 5. 

f(1)=a(1)+b(1)+2
5=a+b+2

We also know that f(2)=8. This means that when we plug in 2 for x in our equation, we get 8. 

f(2)=a(2)+b(2)+2
8=2a+2b+2

Now, we want to solve for f(3). We can do this by plugging in 3 for x in our equation. 

f(3)=a(3)+b(3)+2
f(3)=3a+3b+2

We have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve this system of equations using substitution. 

3a+3b+2=f(3)
a+b+2=5

a+b=3
3a+3b+2=f(3)
9a+2=f(3)
9a=f(3)-2
a=(f(3)-2)/9

Now that we have solved for a, we can plug this back into one of our original equations to solve for b. 

a+b=3
(f(3)-2)/9+b=3
b=3-(f(3)-2)/9

Now that we have solved for both a and b, we can plug these values back into our original equation to solve for f(3). 

f(3)=(f(3)-2)/9(3)+(3-(f(3)-2)/9)(3)+2
f(3)=3(f(3)-2)/9+3(3-(f(3)-2)/9)+2

A: Let's think step by step."," 

First, we need to find the slope of the line 3x-2y = 6. We can do this by solving for y:

y = (3/2)x - 3

Now that we have the slope, we know that the slope of the line perpendicular to this line will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of 3/2. This means that the slope of the line perpendicular to 3x-2y = 6 is -2/3.

Now that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a line to write the equation of the line perpendicular to 3x-2y = 6 with y-intercept 2.

y - 2 = -(2/3)(x - 0)

y = -(2/3)x + 2",,"[9, 7, 15, 5, 13, 14, 10, 12, 3, 4, 6, 2, 1, 11]","""""""
