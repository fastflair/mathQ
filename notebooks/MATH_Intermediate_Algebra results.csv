A: Let's think step by step.","

First, we can square both sides of the equation to get rid of the radicals:

x√(12 - x) + √(12x - x^3) ≥ 12

x(12 - x) + (12x - x^3) ≥ 144

12x - x^2 + 12x - x^3 ≥ 144

-x^2 + 25x - 144 ≥ 0

Now we can use the Quadratic Formula to solve for x:

x = (25 ± √(625 - 576))/2

x = (25 ± 49)/2

x = 12 ± 7

x = 19 or x = 5",,"[11, 7, 2, 4, 8, 12, 6, 13, 15, 9, 3, 5, 14, 10]","""""""

First, we can simplify the equation a bit:

First, we can see that the sum is a geometric sum, so we can write it as:

We know that:

We can simplify this to:

\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{5n}{k^n} = \frac{13}{4} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^n}\]

\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{5n}{k^n} = \frac{5}{k-1} + \frac{13/4}{k-1}\]

Q: Let r and s denote the two real roots of x^2 - x \sqrt{5} + 1 = 0. Then determine r^8 + s^8.
A: Let's think step by step.","

First, we need to find the roots of the equation. We can do this by factoring:

x^2 - x \sqrt{5} + 1 = (x - \sqrt{5})(x - \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}})

This gives us the roots:

r = \sqrt{5}
s = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}

Now, we need to find r^8 + s^8. We can do this by plugging in the values for r and s:

r^8 + s^8 = (\sqrt{5})^8 + (\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}})^8

This simplifies to:

r^8 + s^8 = 5^4 + 5^{-4}

Which is equal to:

r^8 + s^8 = 625 + 0.00390625

Therefore, the answer is 625 + 0.00390625.",

$\lceil \log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rceil- \lfloor\log_{\sqrt{2}}{k} \rfloor$ is equal to $0$ when $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$.
$\lceil \log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rceil- \lfloor\log_{\sqrt{2}}{k} \rfloor$ is equal to $1$ when $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$ times an odd number.
$\lceil \log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rceil- \lfloor\log_{\sqrt{2}}{k} \rfloor$ is equal to $2$ when $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$ times an even number that is not a power of $2$.

Now we can write the sum as
$$\sum_{k=1}^{1000} k(\lceil \log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rceil- \lfloor\log_{\sqrt{2}}{k} \rfloor) = \sum_{k=1}^{1000} k(0) + \sum_{k=1}^{1000} k(1) + \sum_{k=1}^{1000} k(2)$$
The first sum is $0$ because $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$ when $k(0)$ is $0$.
The second sum is $1$ because $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$ times an odd number when $k(1)$ is $1$.
The third sum is $2$ because $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$ times an even number that is not a power of $2$ when $k(2)$ is $2$.

Therefore, the sum is $0 + 1 + 2 = 3$.",,"[3, 8, 11, 6, 9, 4, 2, 5, 7, 1, 12, 13, 14, 15]","""""""
