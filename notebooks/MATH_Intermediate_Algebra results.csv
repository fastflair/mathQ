A: Let's think step by step.","

First, we can square both sides of the equation to get rid of the radicals:

x√(12 - x) + √(12x - x^3) ≥ 12

x(12 - x) + (12x - x^3) ≥ 144

12x - x^2 + 12x - x^3 ≥ 144

-x^2 + 25x - 144 ≥ 0

Now we can use the Quadratic Formula to solve for x:

x = (25 ± √(625 - 576))/2

x = (25 ± 49)/2

x = 12 ± 7

The largest possible value of 3x + 4y is 36.",,"Q: Given that x^2 + y^2 = 14x + 6y + 6, find the largest possible value of 3x + 4y.
A: Let's think step by step."," 

First, we can simplify the equation a bit: 

x^2 + y^2 = 14x + 6y + 6 
⇒ x^2 - 14x + y^2 - 6y = 6
⇒ (x - 7)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 6

We can see that this is in the form of a circle equation with the center at (7, 3) and the radius being √6. 

Now, we want to find the point on this circle that is farthest away from the origin. This is the point with the largest possible value of 3x + 4y. 

There are two points that satisfy this condition: (1, 0) and (-1, 0).

First, we can see that the sum is a geometric sum, so we can write it as:

Here's what the above code is doing:
1."," It starts with k = 0 and adds 1 to it until the sum of the series is equal to the target.
2. The sum of the series is initialized to 3.
3. The for loop adds the next term in the series to the sum.
4. The if statement checks if the sum is equal to the target. If it is, the function returns the value of k.

k = 4",,"Q: Find the value of k so that 3 + (3 + k)/4 + (3 + 2k)/4^2 + (3 + 3k)/4^3 + ... = 8.
A: Let's think step by step.","

3 + (3 + k)/4 + (3 + 2k)/4^2 + (3 + 3k)/4^3 + ...

Now we can see the pattern. It's a geometric series with first term 3/4 and common ratio 1/4. We can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to solve for k.

3 + 3/4 + 3/4^2 + 3/4^3 + (3 + k)/4^4 + ... = 8

A: Let's think step by step.","

$\lceil \log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rceil- \lfloor\log_{\sqrt{2}}{k} \rfloor$ is equal to $0$ when $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$.
$\lceil \log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rceil- \lfloor\log_{\sqrt{2}}{k} \rfloor$ is equal to $1$ when $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$ times an odd number.
$\lceil \log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rceil- \lfloor\log_{\sqrt{2}}{k} \rfloor$ is equal to $2$ when $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$ times an even number that is not a power of $2$.

Now we can write the sum as
$$\sum_{k=1}^{1000} k(\lceil \log_{\sqrt{2}}{k}\rceil- \lfloor\log_{\sqrt{2}}{k} \rfloor) = \sum_{k=1}^{1000} k(0) + \sum_{k=1}^{1000} k(1) + \sum_{k=1}^{1000} k(2)$$
The first sum is $0$ because $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$ when $k(0)$ is $0$.
The second sum is $1$ because $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$ times an odd number when $k(1)$ is $1$.
The third sum is $2$ because $k$ is a power of $\sqrt{2}$ times an even number that is not a power of $2$ when $k(2)$ is $2$.

Therefore, the sum is $0 + 1 + 2 = 3$.",,"[3, 8, 11, 6, 9, 4, 2, 5, 7, 1, 12, 13, 14, 15]",,,
