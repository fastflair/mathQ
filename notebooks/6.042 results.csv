The number we are looking for is called the modular inverse of $17$ modulo $72$. 
The number $17$ is called the modulus. 
The number $72$ is called the base.

A: Let's think step by step."," 
First, we need to find a number x such that 11x ≡ 1 (mod 113). 
We know that 113 is a prime number, so we can use the fact that if a and m are relatively prime, then a^-1 ≡ a^(m-2) (mod m). 
We also know that 11 and 113 are relatively prime because their only common factor is 1. 
So we have: 11^-1 ≡ 11^111 (mod 113) 
⇒ x ≡ 11^111 (mod 113) 
⇒ x ≡ 121 (mod 113) 
Now we need to find a number x such that x ≡ 121 (mod 113).

A: Let's think step by step."," 

First, let's think about the probability that a person has finalphobia. We know that the probability of this is 1/100. 

Next, let's think about the probability that a person has shaky hands. We know that the probability of this is 9/10 if the person has finalphobia and 1/20 if the person does not have finalphobia. 

Now, let's think about the probability that a person has finalphobia given that he or she has shaky hands. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this. 

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A divided by the probability of B. 

So, in this case, the probability of finalphobia given shaky hands is equal to the probability of shaky hands given finalphobia times the probability of finalphobia divided by the probability of shaky hands. 

We can plug in the values that we know. The probability of shaky hands given finalphobia is 9/10. The probability of finalphobia is 1/100. The probability of shaky hands is 9/10 times 1/100, which is 9/1000, plus 1/20, which is 1/200, which is 1/150.

A: Let's think step by step."," 

A relaxed student rolls a fair, 6-sided die in the morning. 

There are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

The probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6. The probability of rolling a number other than 1 is 5/6. 

If he rolls a 1, then he does his laundry immediately (with zero days of delay). Otherwise, he delays for one day and repeats the experiment the following morning. 

This means that if he rolls a 1, R = 0. If he rolls a number other than 1, R = 1 + R', where R' is a new random variable that is the number of days of delay for the second day. 

Therefore, we have: 

Ex (R) = (1/6) * 0 + (5/6) * (1 + Ex (R'))

Ex (R') is a new random variable that is the number of days of delay for the second day. This is a different random variable than R, so we cannot simply plug R in for R'. We need to find the expected value for R' and plug that in. 

We can use the same reasoning as before. We know that: 

Ex (R') = (1/6) * 0 + (5/6) * (1 + Ex (R''))

R'' is a new random variable that is the number of days of delay for the third day. We need to find the expected value for R'' and plug that in. 

We can keep going like this until we get to a point where we can solve for Ex (R). 

Ex (R) = (1/6) * 0 + (5/6) * (1 + Ex (R'))

Ex (R') = (1/6) * 0 + (5/6) * (1 + Ex (R''))

Ex (R'') = (1/6) * 0 + (5/6) * (1 + Ex (R'''))

...

Ex (Rn) = (1/6) * 0 + (5/6) * (1 + Ex (Rn+1))

We can solve this using geometric series. We get: 

Ex (Rn) = (5/6)n

Therefore, 

Ex (R) = limn→∞ (5/6)n

The limit of this goes to infinity, so the expected value of R is infinity.",,"[7, 5, 9, 4, 11, 10, 22, 8, 17, 23, 19, 21, 12, 3, 20, 16, 1, 24, 25, 13, 2, 15, 18, 14]","""""""

Q: MIT students sometimes delay laundry for a few days. Assume all random values described below are mutually independent. Before doing laundry, an unlucky student must recover from illness for a number of days equal to the product of the numbers rolled on two fair, 6-sided dice. Let U be the expected number of days an unlucky student delays laundry. What is Ex (U)? 
A: Let's think step by step."," 

First, the student rolls two dice. The possible outcomes are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), and so on. 

There are 36 possible outcomes in total. 

Now, we need to calculate the expected value for each of the possible outcomes. 

For example, if the student rolls a (1,1), then he will have to recover from illness for 1 day. 

If the student rolls a (1,2), then he will have to recover from illness for 2 days. 

And so on. 

Once we have calculated the expected value for each of the possible outcomes, we can add them all up to get the expected value for U.",
