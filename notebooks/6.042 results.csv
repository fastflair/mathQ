Here's what the above code is doing:
1."," get_score() returns a random score from the set {50, 51, . . . , 97, 98}
2. get_scores(n) returns a list of n scores
3. get_mean(scores) returns the mean of the scores
4. get_variance(scores) returns the variance of the scores
5. get_std_dev(scores) returns the standard deviation of the scores
6. get_covariance(scores1, scores2) returns the covariance of scores1 and scores2
7. get_correlation(scores1, scores2) returns the correlation of scores1 and scores2
