A: Let's think step by step."," 
There are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the two digits that will sum to 9. For example, we could have $(1,8)$, $(2,7)$, $(3,6)$, $(4,5)$, $(5,4)$, or $(6,3)$. 
For each of these six possibilities, we need to choose the remaining two digits. For example, if we have chosen $(1,8)$, then we need to choose two digits from the set $\{0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9\}$ such that their sum is not a multiple of 11. (This is because the sum of the digits in the number $18xyz$ is a multiple of 11 if and only if the sum of the digits in the number $xyz$ is a multiple of 11.) 
There are $\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to choose the remaining two digits. 
Thus, there are $6\cdot 28=168$ four-digit numbers whose digits sum to 9 and which are divisible by 11.
