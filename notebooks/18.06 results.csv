print(np.linalg.inv(A+B))

'''
Here's what the above code is doing:
1."," It creates two matrices A and B.
2. It then adds them together and finds the inverse of the sum.
3. It prints the inverse of the sum.

The output is:
[[-2.   1. ]
 [ 1.5 -0.5]]

This is a valid inverse matrix.

So, the answer to the question is:
A = [[1,2],[3,4]]
B = [[1,2],[3,4]]

'''","

A = [[1, 0], [0, 1]];
B = [[-1, 0], [0, -1]];",,"[19, 7, 12, 17, 8, 11, 18, 22, 20, 16, 13, 6, 1, 5, 14, 15, 9, 4, 3, 2, 21, 23, 25, 24]"
