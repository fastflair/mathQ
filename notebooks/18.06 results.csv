w_1 is the vector (1;2;3)

w_3 is the vector (7;8;9)
A: Let's think step by step."," 

First, we need to find a combination of w_1, w_2, and w_3 that gives the zero vector. 

That is, we need to find numbers x_1, x_2, and x_3 such that: 

x_1*w_1 + x_2*w_2 + x_3*w_3 = 0 

We can rewrite this equation as a matrix equation: 

[x_1 x_2 x_3] * [w_1 w_2 w_3] = 0 

We can think of the matrix [x_1 x_2 x_3] as a row vector, and the matrix [w_1 w_2 w_3] as a column vector. 

Therefore, the equation above is saying that the dot product of the row vector and the column vector is equal to zero. 

We can use the properties of the dot product to simplify this equation. 

Remember, the dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of the first elements, plus the product of the second elements, plus the product of the third elements. 

Therefore, we can rewrite the equation above as: 

(x_1 * w_1) + (x_2 * w_2) + (x_3 * w_3) = 0 

Now we just need to find numbers x_1, x_2, and x_3 such that the equation above is true. 

One solution is x_1 = -4, x_2 = 5, and x_3 = -6. 

Therefore, the solution to the original equation is: 

x_1*w_1 + x_2*w_2 + x_3*w_3 = (-4)*(1,2,3) + 5*(4,5,6) + (-6)*(7,8,9) = (0,0,0)",

First, we need a rotation matrix. The general form of a rotation matrix is 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta

where $\theta$ is the angle of rotation. 
In our case, we want the angle of rotation to be 45 degrees, or $\pi/4$ radians. Therefore, our rotation matrix is 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \frac{\pi}{4} & -\sin \frac{\pi}{4} \\
\sin \frac{\pi}{4} & \cos \frac{\pi}{4}
\end{bmatrix}

A: Let's think step by step.","

First, we need to calculate the inverse of the matrix [10,20;20,50].

To do this, we need to calculate the determinant of the matrix, which is (10*50)-(20*20) = 500.

Now that we have the determinant, we can calculate the inverse of the matrix using the following formula:

[10,20;20,50]^-1 = 1/500 * [50,-20;-20,10]

Now that we have the inverse of the matrix, we can solve for the first column of A^-1.

To do this, we need to multiply the inverse of the matrix by the column vector [1;0].

[10,20;20,50]^-1 * [1;0] = (1/500) * [50,-20;-20,10] * [1;0]

Which gives us the following result:

[x;y] = (1/500) * [50;-20]

Now we can solve for the second column of A^-1.

To do this, we need to multiply the inverse of the matrix by the column vector [0;1].

[10,20;20,50]^-1 * [0;1] = (1/500) * [50,-20;-20,10] * [0;1]

Which gives us the following result:

A: Let's think step by step."," We want to solve for the first column of A^−1, so we need to find x and y such that:

[10,20;20,50]@[x;y] = [1;0]

This is the same as saying:

10x + 20y = 1
20x + 50y = 0

We can solve this using any method we want, but let's use substitution. We can solve the second equation for y in terms of x:

y = -2x

Now we can plug this back into the first equation:

10x - 20(-2x) = 1
10x + 40x = 1
50x = 1
x = 1/50

Now we can plug this back into the equation for y to find y:

y = -2(1/50)
y = -1/25

So the first column of A^−1 is:

A^−1 = [1/50, -1/25; ?, ?]

We can use a similar process to solve for the second column of A^−1. We want to find t and z such that:

[10,20;20,50]@[t;z] = [0;1]

This is the same as saying:

10t + 20z = 0
20t + 50z = 1

We can solve this using any method we want, but let's use substitution. We can solve the first equation for z in terms of t:

z = -1/2t

Now we can plug this back into the second equation:

20t - 10(-1/2t) = 1
20t + 5t = 1
25t = 1
t = 1/25

Now we can plug this back into the equation for z to find z:

z = -1/2(1/25)
z = -1/50

So the second column of A^−1 is:

A^−1 = [1/50, -1/25; 1/25, -1/50]",
