First, we can add the first and third equations to get:

7x + 7z + 9w = 2

Now, we can subtract twice the second equation from the first and third equations to get:

x - 3y + 2z - w = -5

Now, we can add the second and fourth equations to get:

-6x + 12y + 12z + 3w = 6

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get:

-10x + 12y + 4z + 4w = 7

Now, we can subtract the third equation from the fourth equation to get:

4x + 8y + 2z - 2w = 9

We now have a system of three equations in three unknowns. We can solve this using elimination.

Adding the first and second equations, we get:

-6x + 12y + 4z + 4w = 7

Adding the first and third equations, we get:

4x + 8y + 2z - 2w = 9

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the third equation to get:

10x + 4y + 2w = 2

We now have a system of two equations in two unknowns. We can solve this using elimination.

Adding the first and second equations, we get:

4x + 8y + 2z - 2w = 9

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to get:

2x + 2z - 2w = -1

We now have a system of two equations in two unknowns. We can solve this using substitution.

From the second equation, we can solve for w in terms of x and z:

w = x + z - 1

Now, we can plug this value of w into the first equation and solve for x in terms of z:

2x + 2z - 2(x + z - 1) = -1

2x + 2z - 2x - 2z + 2 = -1

4z + 2 = -1

4z = -3

z = -3/4

Now that we know the value of z, we can plug it back into the equation for w to solve for w:

w = x + z - 1

w = x - 3/4 - 1

w = x - 7/4

Now that we know the value of w, we can plug it back into the equation for x to solve for x:

2x + 2z - 2(x - 7/4) = -1

A: Let's think step by step.","

First, we need to figure out how many tons of copper and kilograms of silver each mine produces in one day. We can do this by creating a matrix that contains the output of each mine in one day.

A = [10 120; 6 140]

Next, we need to figure out how many days each mine should operate in order to produce the desired output of 72 tons of copper and 1340 kilograms of silver.

We can do this by creating a matrix that contains the number of days each mine should operate.

B = [72/10 1340/120; 72/6 1340/140]

Finally, we need to calculate the number of days each mine should operate in order to produce the desired output.

A*B = [7 11; 12 10]

Therefore, mine A should operate for 7 days and mine B should operate for 12 days.",

First, we need to find the angle between the minute and hour hands at noon. We know that the minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, and the hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours. This means that in one minute, the minute hand moves 360/60 = 6 degrees, and in one hour, the hour hand moves 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, in one minute, the hour hand moves 30/60 = 0.5 degrees.

Now we need to find the angle between the minute and hour hands at 1:15.

A: Let's think step by step."," 
The first vector in the basis is [2,-1/2]. This means that the first coordinate is 2 and the second coordinate is -1/2. 
The second vector in the basis is [1,1]. This means that the first coordinate is 1 and the second coordinate is 1.

[2;1] = x[2,-1/2] + y[1,1] 
This is equivalent to the following system of equations: 
2 = 2x + y 
1 = -1/2x + y 
We can solve this system of equations using any method we want. For example, we could use substitution. 
We know that 2 = 2x + y. This means that y = 2 - 2x. 
We can plug this value of y into the second equation. 
1 = -1/2x + (2 - 2x) 
1 = 2 - 3/2x 
3/2x = 1 - 2 
3/2x = -1 
x = -2/3 
Now that we know the value of x, we can plug it back into the equation y = 2 - 2x to find the value of y. 
y = 2 - 2(-2/3)

Here's what the above code is doing:
1."," We define the vector v and the line l.
2. We compute the projection of v onto l by taking the dot product of v and l, dividing by the dot product of l and l, and then multiplying by l.
3. We print the result.

The orthogonal projection of the vector [-6;4] onto the line spanned by the vector [3;2] is [-2;1].",,"Q: Compute the orthogonal projection of the vector [-6;4] onto the line spanned by the vector [3;2]
A: Let's think step by step."," 
First, we need to find a unit vector in the direction of the line. 
The direction vector is [3;2]. 
The unit vector is [3/5;2/5]. 
Next, we need to find the scalar multiple. 
The scalar multiple is the dot product of the vector and the unit vector. 
The dot product is [-6(3/5)+4(2/5)] = -12/5+8/5 = -4/5. 
Therefore, the orthogonal projection is [-4/5(3/5);-4/5(2/5)] = [-12/25;-8/25].",,"[12, 8, 21, 14, 2, 22, 19, 18, 13, 16, 23, 17, 1, 11, 15, 24, 9, 20, 7, 25, 6, 3, 5, 4]","""""""
