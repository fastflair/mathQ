There are 13 possible values for a three-of-a-kind poker hand:

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace

There are 4*13 = 52 ways to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52 cards.

There are C(52,3) = 52!/(3!*49!) = 2,598,960 ways to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52 cards.

There are 13 possible values for the first card. For the second card, there are now 12 possible values (since we've already used one of them). For the third card, there are 11 possible values, and for the fourth card, there are 10 possible values. Finally, for the fifth card, there are 9 possible values. 

We can calculate the probability of getting a three-of-a-kind hand by multiplying all of these probabilities together.

A: Let's think step by step.","

First, we need to calculate the variance of Y. The variance of a random variable is defined as the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean. In other words, it's the expected value of (Y - μ)2.

We can calculate the expected value of Y using the formula E(Y) = (1/6) * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6). This gives us μ = 3.5.

Now we need to calculate the expected value of (Y - μ)2. This is just the expected value of Y2 - 2μY + μ2. We can calculate the expected value of Y2 using the formula E(Y2) = (1/6) * (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2). This gives us E(Y2) = 91/6.

Plugging this into our formula for the expected value of (Y - μ)2, we get E((Y - μ)2) = 91/6 - 2(3.5)(91/6) + (3.5)2. This simplifies to E((Y - μ)2) = 91/6 - 63/2 + 12.25, which is about 2.75.

So the variance of Y is Var(Y) = E((Y - μ)2) = 2.75.

Now we just take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation, which is √2.75 = about 1.65.",

A: Let's think step by step."," 

First, let's calculate the probability of X being greater than Y. We can do this by looking at all possible combinations of X and Y. 

There are 4 possible outcomes for X: 1, 2, 3, 4. 
There are 6 possible outcomes for Y: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

There are 24 possible combinations of X and Y. 

There are 6 ways that X can be greater than Y: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4). 

Therefore, the probability of X being greater than Y is 6/24, or 1/4. 

Now, let's calculate the expected value of this game. 

The expected value is the sum of all possible values multiplied by their respective probabilities. 

There are two possible values in this game: 2X dollars and -1 dollar. 

The probability of winning 2X dollars is 1/4. 
The probability of losing 1 dollar is 3/4. 

Therefore, the expected value is: 

(2X)(1/4) + (-1)(3/4) 

= (2/4)X + (-3/4) 

= 1/2X - 3/4 

Now, let's plug in X=1,2,3,4 and see what we get. 

When X=1, we get: 

1/2(1) - 3/4 = -1/4 

When X=2, we get: 

1/2(2) - 3/4 = 0 

When X=3, we get: 

1/2(3) - 3/4 = 1/4 

When X=4, we get: 

1/2(4) - 3/4 = 1 

Therefore, the expected value of this game is 0. 

Now, let's calculate the expected total gain after playing the game 60 times. 

The expected total gain is simply the expected value multiplied by the number of times the game is played. 

Therefore, the expected total gain is:

There are 1200 raisins in a box.",,"Q: Boxes of Raisin Bran cereal are 30cm tall. Due to settling, boxes have a higher density of raisins at the bottom (h = 0) than at the top (h = 30). Suppose the density (in raisins per cm of height) is given by f(h) = 40 − h. How many raisins are in a box?
A: Let's think step by step."," 

The first thing we need to do is figure out how to find the number of raisins in a box if we know the density function. 

We can do this by finding the integral of the density function from 0 to 30. 

This will give us the total number of raisins in the box. 

Now that we know how to find the number of raisins in the box, we can plug in the given density function to find the answer. 

The integral of the given density function is 40h - h^2. 

When we plug in 0 for h, we get 0. 

When we plug in 30 for h, we get 1200. 

Therefore, there are 1200 raisins in the box.",,"[11, 22, 21, 18, 17, 6, 8, 7, 24, 23, 12, 3, 2, 19, 20, 15, 9, 5, 4, 16, 13, 1, 14, 25]","""""""
