1."," The function distinct_digits(n) takes a number n and returns True if all the digits in n are distinct.
2. The function count_odd_distinct_digits() counts the number of odd numbers between 100 and 999 that have distinct digits.

There are 9 choices for the first digit. For each of these choices, there are 8 choices for the second digit (because it can't be the same as the first). For each of *these* choices, there are 7 choices for the third digit. So the answer is $9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 = 504$.

There are 9 choices for the first digit, 8 for the second, and 7 for the third. This gives us 9 * 8 * 7 = 504 possibilities. 

However, we have counted some numbers multiple times. For example, we counted both 132 and 231 as possibilities. So we must subtract the number of ways to choose 3 distinct digits from 9, 8, and 7. This is 9 * 8 * 7 - 9 * 8 = 432. 

Therefore, there are 504 - 432 = 72 possibilities.",
