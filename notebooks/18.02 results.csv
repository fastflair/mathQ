First, we can rewrite the equation in standard form: 

(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2

where h and k are the coordinates of the center of the circle, and r is the radius. 

Now, we can plug in a known point on the circle, such as (1, 1). 

(1 - h)^2 + (1 - k)^2 = r^2

We can solve for h: 

h = 1 - sqrt(r^2 - (1 - k)^2)

We can plug this back into the original equation: 

x^2 + 2x + y^2 = 4

(1 - (1 - sqrt(r^2 - (1 - k)^2)))^2 + 2(1 - (1 - sqrt(r^2 - (1 - k)^2))) + y^2 = 4

This simplifies to: 

sqrt(r^2 - (1 - k)^2) = 1 - y

We can solve for r: 

r = sqrt((1 - y)^2 + (1 - k)^2)

A: Let's think step by step."," We need the arc length of the curve from 5 to 12. This is the same as the arc length of the curve from 0 to 7. We can parameterize the curve as x = 2t and y = 2/3*t^(3/2). Then, the arc length is given by the integral:

int_5^12 sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx

= int_5^12 sqrt(1 + (4/3*t^(1/2))^2) dx

= int_5^12 sqrt(1 + 16/9*t) dx

= int_5^12 sqrt(41/9)*sqrt(1 + t/41) dx

= sqrt(41/9)*int_5^12 sqrt(1 + t/41) dx

This integral can be solved using a trigonometric substitution. Let t = 41*sin(theta). Then, dx = 41*cos(theta) dtheta and the integral becomes:

= sqrt(41/9)*int_5^12 sqrt(1 + 41*sin(theta))*41*cos(theta) dtheta

= 41*sqrt(41/9)*int_5^12 sqrt(1 + sin(theta))*cos(theta) dtheta

This integral can be solved using a trigonometric identity. Let's use the identity:

sin(theta)*cos(theta) = 1/2*sin(2theta)

= 41*sqrt(41/9)*int_5^12 1/2*sin(2theta) dtheta

= 41*sqrt(41/9)*(-1/2*cos(2theta))|_5^12

= 41*sqrt(41/9)*(-1/2*cos(2*12) + 1/2*cos(2*5))

= 41*sqrt(41/9)*(-1/2*cos(24) + 1/2*cos(10))

A: Let's think step by step."," 

First, we know that the equation of an ellipse with foci at $(-2,2)$ and $(4,2)$ and eccentricity $e$ is given by 
$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$
where $a$ and $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. 

We also know that the eccentricity of an ellipse is given by 
$$e = \frac{c}{a}$$
where $c$ is the distance between the foci. 

So, we can plug in what we know to solve for $a$ and $b$: 
$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{\left(\frac{c}{e}\right)^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{\left(\frac{4}{1/3}\right)^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies b^2 = \frac{16y^2}{16 - x^2}$$

Therefore, the equation of the ellipse specified is 
$$\frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{\frac{16y^2}{16 - x^2}} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{y^2}{16 - x^2} = 1$$",,"[2, 6, 23, 4, 7, 5, 24, 12, 21, 11, 3, 20, 1, 25, 9, 17, 10, 19, 22, 18, 13, 16, 15, 14]","""""""
