First, we need to find the derivative of the function. 

$$L'(t) = 0.04323t^2 - 0.8354t + 2.703$$

Next, we need to set the derivative equal to zero and solve for t. 

$$0.04323t^2 - 0.8354t + 2.703 = 0$$

This is a quadratic equation, so we can use the quadratic equation to solve for t. 

$$t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

$$a = 0.04323$$
$$b = -0.8354$$
