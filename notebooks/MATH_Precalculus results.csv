(a + b) * (a - b) = 9",,"Q: If ||a|| = 3 and ||b|| = 6, then find (a + b) * (a - b).
A: Let's think step by step.","

First, we need to calculate (a + b). This is easy, because all we need to do is add the corresponding components:

(a + b) = (a1 + b1, a2 + b2, a3 + b3)

Next, we need to calculate (a - b). This is also easy, because all we need to do is subtract the corresponding components:

(a - b) = (a1 - b1, a2 - b2, a3 - b3)

Now we need to calculate (a + b) * (a - b). There are a few ways to do this, but the easiest is probably to use the distributive property:

(a + b) * (a - b) = (a1 + b1) * (a1 - b1) + (a2 + b2) * (a2 - b2) + (a3 + b3) * (a3 - b3)

Now we just need to simplify each term. For the first term, we have:

(a1 + b1) * (a1 - b1) = a1^2 - b1^2

For the second term, we have:

(a2 + b2) * (a2 - b2) = a2^2 - b2^2

And for the third term, we have:

(a3 + b3) * (a3 - b3) = a3^2 - b3^2

Putting everything together, we have:

(a + b) * (a - b) = a1^2 - b1^2 + a2^2 - b2^2 + a3^2 - b3^2",,"[6, 4, 7, 2, 12, 13, 10, 8, 15, 9, 11, 5, 3, 14]"

The image of (0, 0) is (2(0) + 1(0), 7(0) - 3(0)) = (2, 7). 
The image of (10, 0) is (2(10) + 1(0), 7(10) - 3(0)) = (22, 67).

Here's what the above code is doing:
1."," The distance function calculates the distance between two points.
2. The area function calculates the area of a triangle using the distance function.
3. The area function is called with the coordinates of the three vertices of the triangle.

The area of the triangle is 36.",,"Q: Find the area of the triangle with vertices (-1,4), (7,0), and (11,5).
A: Let's think step by step."," 

First, we need to find the length of each side of the triangle. The length of side AB can be found using the distance formula, which is the square root of (xb-xa)^2+(yb-ya)^2. In this case, that's the square root of (7-(-1))^2+(0-4)^2, which is the square root of 100, or 10. 

Similarly, the length of side BC is the square root of (11-7)^2+(5-0)^2, which is the square root of 36, or 6. 

The length of side AC is a little trickier, since it's not one of the sides of the rectangle that the triangle is inscribed in. However, we can still use the distance formula. It's the square root of (11-(-1))^2+(5-4)^2, which is the square root of 324, or 18. 

Now that we have the lengths of all three sides, we can use Heron's Formula, which is A=sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, and s is half the perimeter of the triangle. In this case, s=(10+6+18)/2, or s=34/2, or s=17. 

Therefore, A=sqrt(17(17-10)(17-6)(17-18)), which is sqrt(17*7*11*-1), or sqrt(17*7*11*-1), or sqrt(-1197), or about 34.4.",,"[5, 4, 12, 1, 6, 11, 9, 2, 8, 15, 3, 7, 13, 14]"
