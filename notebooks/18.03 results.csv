First, we need to find the general solution to the differential equation. We can do this by using the integrating factor method. 

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x+1$$

$$\mu(x) = e^{\int 2x+1 \,dx} = e^{x^2+x}$$

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left(e^{x^2+x}y\right) = e^{x^2+x}\frac{dy}{dx}$$

$$\implies e^{x^2+x}y = \int e^{x^2+x}(2x+1) \,dx$$

$$\implies y = \frac{1}{e^{x^2+x}}\int e^{x^2+x}(2x+1) \,dx$$

$$\implies y = \frac{1}{e^{x^2+x}}\left[e^{x^2+x}(2x+1)\right] - \frac{1}{e^{x^2+x}}\int e^{x^2+x} \,dx$$

$$\implies y = \frac{1}{e^{x^2+x}}\left[e^{x^2+x}(2x+1) - e^{x^2+x}\right]$$

$$\implies y = \frac{1}{e^{x^2+x}}\left[2xe^{x^2+x}+e^{x^2+x}-e^{x^2+x}\right]$$

$$\implies y = \frac{1}{e^{x^2+x}}\left[2xe^{x^2}e^x+e^{2x+1}-e^{x^2+x}\right]$$

$$\implies y = \frac{1}{e^{x^2+x}}\left[2xe^{x^2}e^x+e^{x^2}e^x-e^{x^2}e^x\right]$$

$$\implies y = \frac{1}{e^{x^2+x}}\left[2xe^{x^2}e^x\right]$$

$$\implies y = \frac{2xe^{x^2}}{e^{2x+1}}$$

Now that we have the general solution, we can find the particular solution by plugging in the initial condition. 

$$y(0) = \frac{2(0)e^{0^2}}{e^{2(0)+1}} = \frac{0}{e^1} = 0$$

Therefore, the particular solution is 

$$y_p(x) = 0$$

And the final solution is 

$$y(x) = y_c(x) + y_p(x) = c_1e^{-x^2-x} + 0$$",

A: Let's think step by step."," We can see that this is a first order differential equation, so we can use an integrating factor to solve it.

First, we need to find the integrating factor. We can do this by solving the equation:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} + 2xy = 0 \iff \frac{dy}{dx} = -2xy$$

This is a separable differential equation, so we can solve it by separating the variables:

$$\int \frac{dy}{y} = \int -2x \, dx$$

$$\ln |y| = -x^2 + C$$

$$y = Ce^{-x^2}$$

Now that we have the integrating factor, we can use it to solve the original differential equation:

$$\frac{d}{dx} \left( Ce^{-x^2} y \right) = 0$$

$$Ce^{-x^2} y = D$$

$$y = \frac{D}{Ce^{-x^2}}$$

We can see that this is a general solution to the differential equation. If we are given an initial condition, we can use it to find the corresponding particular solution. For example, if we are given the initial condition $y(0) = 5$, we can plug it into the general solution to find the particular solution:

$$y = \frac{D}{Ce^{-x^2}}$$

$$5 = \frac{D}{Ce^{0}}$$

$$D = 5C$$

$$y = \frac{5C}{Ce^{-x^2}}$$

$$y = 5e^{x^2}$$",

A: Let's think step by step.","

The first thing we want to do is solve the homogeneous equation, which is just y' + y = 0. We can do this by inspection: the solution is just y = e^-x.

Now we want to solve the inhomogeneous equation, which is y' + y = 2. We can do this by using an integrating factor, which is e^x.

Multiplying both sides by e^x, we get:

e^x(y' + y) = 2e^x

Now we can use the product rule on the left side:

e^xy' + e^xy = 2e^x

Now we can solve this equation using the method of undetermined coefficients. We guess that the solution has the form y = Ax + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging this into the equation, we get:

Ae^x + Be^x + Ae^x + Be^x = 2e^x

A + B = 2

A = 2 - B

Now we can plug this back into the original equation:

(2 - B)e^x + Be^x = 2e^x

-Be^x + Be^x = 0

B = 0

A = 2

Therefore, the solution to the inhomogeneous equation is y = 2x.

Now we just need to find the particular solution that satisfies the initial condition. We can do this by plugging in the initial condition and solving for C:

y(0) = 0

2(0) + C = 0

C = 0

Therefore, the particular solution is y = 2x.

The general solution is y = 2x + e^-x.",,"[2, 5, 1, 25, 6, 7, 4, 17, 13, 8, 14, 22, 24, 18, 19, 12, 20, 10, 15, 11, 23, 9, 21, 16]","""""""

f'(x)/(3f(x)(5 - f(x))) = 1

Now we need to integrate both sides:

int f'(x)/(3f(x)(5 - f(x))) dx = int 1 dx

Now we need to use partial fractions to solve this equation:

f'(x)/(3f(x)(5 - f(x))) = (A)/(3f(x)) + (B)/(3(5 - f(x)))

Now we need to find the values of A and B:

A = 3, B = -2/3

f(x) = Ce^(3x) - 2/3e^(-3x/5)

Now we need to find the value of C:

f(0) = 8 = C - 2/3

C = 10/3

f(x) = (10/3)e^(3x) - 2/3e^(-3x/5)

Now we need to sketch the graph of the function:

y'' − 2iy' + 3y = 0

The first thing we need to do is to rewrite this equation in the form of a first-order differential equation. To do this, we need to use an integrating factor.

y'' − 2iy' + 3y = 0

y'(2i − 3) + y = 0

Now we have a first-order differential equation with complex coefficients. We can solve this equation using the methods we learned in the previous lesson.

y' = −(1/2i−3)y

Now we need to find the integrating factor.

μ(x) = e^(∫−(1/2i−3)dx)

μ(x) = e^(−1/2i−3x)

Now we can multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor.

e^(−1/2i−3x)y' = e^(−1/2i−3x)(−(1/2i−3)y)

e^(−1/2i−3x)y' + (1/2i−3)e^(−1/2i−3x)y = 0

r = -2, 0

So the complementary solution is:

f_c(x) = c_1*e^(-2*x) + c_2

Now we need to find a particular solution. We can do this by using the method of variation of parameters. We need to find two functions, W_1(x) and W_2(x), such that:

W_1'(x)*f_2(x) + W_2'(x)*f_1(x) = f(x)

W_1(x)*f_2(x) + W_2(x)*f_1(x) = 0

where f_1(x) and f_2(x) are the two linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous equation. In our case, they are:

f_1(x) = e^(-2*x)

f_2(x) = 1

So we need to solve the following system of differential equations:

W_1'(x)*1 + W_2'(x)*e^(-2*x) = cos(3*x)

W_1(x)*1 + W_2(x)*e^(-2*x) = 0

This is a linear system, so we can use elimination to solve it. First, let's multiply the first equation by -e^(2*x):

-e^(2*x)*W_1'(x)*1 + -e^(2*x)*W_2'(x)*e^(-2*x) = -e^(2*x)*cos(3*x)

Now let's add the two equations:

W_2'(x)*e^(-2*x) - e^(2*x)*W_1'(x)*1 = -e^(2*x)*cos(3*x) + W_1(x)*1 + W_2(x)*e^(-2*x)

W_2'(x)*e^(-2*x) - e^(2*x)*W_1'(x)*1 = cos(3*x)

Now we can integrate both sides:

int(W_2'(x)*e^(-2*x) - e^(2*x)*W_1'(x)*1)dx = int(cos(3*x))dx

W_2(x)*e^(-2*x) - W_1(x)*1 - int(e^(2*x)*cos(3*x))dx = sin(3*x)

Now we can solve for W_1(x) and W_2(x):

W_1(x) = 1 + int(e^(2*x)*cos(3*x))dx

W_2(x) = e^(-2*x)*(sin(3*x) + W_1(x))

Now we just need to find int(e^(2*x)*cos(3*x))dx. We can do this by using integration by parts:

int(e^(2*x)*cos(3*x))dx
= e^(2*x)*sin(3*x) - int(2*e^(2*x)*sin(3*x))dx
= e^(2*x)*sin(3*x) - 2*int(e^(2*x)*cos(3*x))dx
= e^(2*x)*sin(3*x) - 2*(e^(2*x)*sin(3*x) - 3*int(e^(2*x)*sin(3*x))dx)
= e^(2*x)*sin(3*x) - 2*e^(2*x)*sin(3*x) + 6*int(e^(2*x)*cos(3*x))dx
= -4*int(e^(2*x)*cos(3*x))dx

Q: Use the method of variation of parameters to find a particular solution of the given differential equation. f''(x) + 4*f(x) = cos(3*x)
A: Let's think step by step."," 

First, we need to find the general solution of the homogeneous equation, which is f''(x) + 4*f(x) = 0. We can do this by solving the characteristic equation, which is r^2 + 4 = 0. This gives us two roots, r = -2 and r = 2. Therefore, the general solution of the homogeneous equation is f(x) = c_1*e^(-2*x) + c_2*e^(2*x).

Now, we need to find a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation. We can do this by using the method of variation of parameters. First, we need to find two linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous equation, which are y_1(x) = e^(-2*x) and y_2(x) = e^(2*x). Then, we need to find W(x), which is the Wronskian of these two functions. We can do this by taking the derivative of y_1(x) and y_2(x) and then evaluating at x = 0. This gives us W(0) = -4.

Now, we need to find c_1(x) and c_2(x). We can do this by solving the following two equations:

c_1'(x)*e^(-2*x) + c_2'(x)*e^(2*x) = 0
c_1'(x)*e^(-2*x) - c_2'(x)*e^(2*x) = -(1/4)*cos(3*x)

This gives us c_1(x) = (1/8)*sin(3*x) and c_2(x) = -(1/8)*sin(3*x).

Therefore, the particular solution of the given differential equation is f(x) = (1/8)*sin(3*x)*e^(-2*x) - (1/8)*sin(3*x)*e^(2*x).",

$$X(s)=\frac{6}{s^2+9}=\frac{A}{s-3i}+\frac{B}{s+3i}$$

Now, we have
$$A=\lim_{s\to 3i}s(s+3i)\frac{6}{s^2+9}=\lim_{s\to 3i}\frac{6s}{s^2+9}=6$$
and
$$B=\lim_{s\to -3i}s(s-3i)\frac{6}{s^2+9}=\lim_{s\to -3i}\frac{6s}{s^2+9}=6$$

Thus, we have
$$X(s)=\frac{6}{s^2+9}=\frac{6}{s-3i}+\frac{6}{s+3i}$$

Now, we can take the inverse Laplace transform of both sides to get
$$x(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{\frac{6}{s-3i}\}+\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{\frac{6}{s+3i}\}$$

We know that
$$\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{\frac{1}{s-a}\}=e^{at}u(t)$$
and
$$\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{\frac{1}{s+a}\}=e^{-at}u(t)$$

Thus, we have
$$x(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{\frac{6}{s-3i}\}+\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{\frac{6}{s+3i}\}=6e^{3it}u(t)+6e^{-3it}u(t)=12cos(3t)u(t)$$

We can see that there is resonance occurring because the amplitude of the solution is increasing.",
