Here's what the above code is doing:
1."," Define the function x(t) = t sin(3t)
2. Define the function F(t) = 6 cos(3t)
3. Define the function x_hat(w) = (1/(mw^2 - k + iwc))*F(w)
4. Define the function x_t(t) = sum(x_hat(w)*exp(iwt))
5. Define the parameters m, k, and c
6. Define the frequency range w
7. Plot x_hat(w)
8. Define the time range t
9. Plot x(t) and x_t(t)","

The inverse transform of F(t) is:

x(t) = t sin(3t)",,"[7, 20, 12, 1, 19, 14, 6, 13, 4, 22, 17, 3, 5, 8, 25, 18, 11, 24, 9, 2, 23, 15, 21, 16]"
